# Introduction

This project is used to create a FrontEnd for an Ecommerce Application  

## Requirements
We have used fake store Api products as a datasource for the products

### `npm test`


### `npm run build`

What is Redux?  
* Redux is a predictable state management library for JavaScript applications, often used with libraries like React. It provides a centralized store to manage the state of your application, making it easier to understand and debug.


Core Concepts  
* Store: The single source of truth that holds the application's state. The store is immutable, meaning you cannot change its state directly.

* Actions: Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened in the application. Each action must have a type property that indicates the action's type.

* Reducers: Pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state. They define how the state changes in response to actions.

* Dispatch: The process of sending actions to the store. This tells Redux that an event has occurred, prompting the store to update.

* Selectors: Functions that extract specific pieces of state from the store.


Why is Redux Useful?  
+ Predictable State Management: With a single source of truth (the store), it's easy to track how and when the state changes, making it easier to reason about your application.

+ Debugging: Redux provides powerful developer tools that allow you to inspect actions and the state tree. You can time-travel debug, replay actions, and see how state changes over time.

+ Centralized State: Managing application state in one place helps avoid issues with state being scattered across various components, leading to easier state sharing and management.

+ Middleware Support: Redux can be extended with middleware, such as Redux Thunk or Redux Saga, which allow for side effects like asynchronous operations (e.g., API calls) to be handled elegantly.

+ Scalability: Redux is particularly useful for larger applications with complex state logic. It helps maintain organization and structure as the application grows.

+ Ecosystem: Redux has a strong ecosystem with libraries, tools, and community support, making it easier to implement and integrate with other parts of your application.
